    Wesley Brown was born and raised in Canton, Georgia, about an hour north of Atlanta. His mother came from a line of dairy farmers, 
    while his father grew up closer to downtown. Both were also raised in Canton. 
    He had the best of both worlds getting grit, a strong work ethic, and attention to detail with a strong tie to family. 
    Wesley played baseball and basketball through his school years and enjoyed shop classes. 
    He went to college to complete a bachelorâ€™s degree in finance and took up the hobby of woodworking.
