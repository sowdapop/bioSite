<div id="feature">The inspiration for this project stems from the manly persona which the subject carries. 
    Dark, masculine tones represent the subject’s personality while the wood and flannel textures describe his hobbies. 
    The layout is to be uncomplicated as there isn’t much content, but the use of the color palette and images will create the interest. 
    Boxes will help separate text and images, as well as highlight important features. Care will be taken to maintain the simplicity of the design without allowing it to be boring. 
    The goal is to create a warm environment with interesting images and text that is easy to read.
    The fonts I chose were simple and clear. Lato is a somewhat wide-based sans serif font that is easy on the eyes without being playful. 
    Roboto Slab is a similarly wide-based serif font that is masculine without feeling like typewriter or old school fonts. Both fonts have small enough kerning that spacing it out for layout purposes should not affect the appearance. 
    There are a variety of weight options in both families, which offers more options for the design.
